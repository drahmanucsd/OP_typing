{"prompt": "What is the difference between Extroverted Thinking (Te) and Introverted Thinking (Ti)?", "completion": 
"all right there should be getting easier
for you thinking T versus TI so what's
thinking its reasons about logic reasons
why'd you buy this lawnmower oh let me
give you ten reasons
now you may use logic as a sub point for
those reasons but it's reasons thinking
is the opposite of feeling what's
feeling values I like this I like this
lawnmower why cuz my dead grandmother
gave it to me that's why get off me okay
sorry so when you're working on typing
Thinking Ti
people you really got to know that
everybody has thinking stupid look at
the INFP isfp ENFJ and es afraid oh I'm
thinking last I'm thinking of one ion of
P in particular who's a business guy and
it's like he has far better T than me
real hard bar to jump over I know it's
play long you get people of these four
types here and if they're obsessing over
whatever it is that they're F valuing
and then they have the double observers
in the middle and then they throw 20 or
30 years on that it doesn't matter how
far behind their T is they get caught up
why because if they really really value
this F I value this 4fe value that and
they're really paying attention to the
observations which they are because I
got double observers in the middle they
see that their doesn't work if
they're not standing on some solid tee
this forces them to develop their T so
when people come and say I really see
this way of life that you value it's
really great but what are some reasons
that I should invest in it I like it I
believe in you but how do I know it's
gonna work down the road and then
developing that T gives them the ability
to communicate to the tribe here's my
reasons here's my te reasons my TI
reasons here's why you can trust this
Thinking Te vs Ti
thing so the point is if you're some int
J or int P you think you're smarter than
everyone which probably are when you
come across somebody out there that is
one of these feeling dominant types and
they have a better T than you if your
worldview of types isn't ready for that
you will always miss type them as
somebody else why because your brain
says they can't exist all right so let's
get into it the best way to think about
thinking think about thinking right
it's just that its reasons and it's a
human tool it's in contrast to feeling
which is more of an ancient animalistic
valuing tool so all animals are more
feeling dominant they just value I like
this I don't like this I'm afraid of
this thinking now gives the reason so
the ancient pioneers like hey I'm in my
nice cozy village why would I ever want
to leave
it's the later human mind it's hard to
develop the end of like I know things
are good now but things might be bad in
the future and then the T says I know we
value this land we live in now but there
might be some good reasons
for us to leave what we value and go
look over on the other side of that
mountain and it's the humans that can do
this consciously animals just kind of
wander around like idiots so let's jump
Google
in real quick to the Google to see how
to do this wrong you get your TI
introverted thinking thinks internally
non-confrontational inductive logic
organizing ideas organizing uh-oh you
know what that is and detached yeah sure
they are kinda teehee thinks
out loud pragmatic confrontational needs
objective proof deductive logic the
thing with thinking is that it it's
exactly the same thing whether it's Ti
or teehee it's a hundred percent the
same the only difference is the TI is
focusing in on one specific area
according to their identity and te is
looking at the wider spectrum for tribe
validation but as far as do they use
deductive or end up go talk to your
uncle who's lead TI
like hey ya do you not use deductive
logic and watch what he does somebody
was strong t wants all the tools all the
reasons a TI is gonna think out loud
they're gonna be pragmatic they're gonna
be confrontational they're gonna need
objective proof they're gonna use
deductive logic why cuz he's trying to
work on his car and get it fixed and he
wants to know that he actually can get
the damn car working does the TI guy
know these got to communicate with
others yes does he got a look at the
spectrum of other cars and learn from
other people yes and in the same way the
other way around with the te-te is
constantly thinking internally because
they're comparing the different reasons
of the tribe they're often more non
confrontational why because they have
the need for tribe validation they're
trying to please people and use
inductive logic all day long organizing
ideas and well now that's the observer
stuff and then detached that's just
depending on whether you're an
or not these Google pages are shooting
flares getting to chase the wrong stuff
they're they're taking a hodgepodge of
symptoms that are kind of anecdotally
true sometimes and generally true I mean
we get what they're saying here but if
you were to specifically try and take
this out to the field with a checklist
and try and type people with this
yeah that's gonna break down real fast
so with the T versus T I what you really
Human Needs
narrow in on is the human needs so T I
you're looking for is this person's
identity about these reasons and then
are they then using Fe to see if other
people like these reasons and then the
TE is are they using their reasons to
communicate with the tribe and look for
tribe validation hey I've got these
really good reasons does the tribe
like it do you think I'm cool because
these good reasons and the teehee person
is coming from the identity of their F I
see some big ENTJ or ESTJ who dominates
the reason spectrum and then go why
you're doing this like oh because I want
to be a good dad he's got some emotional
value that he's attached to then you ask
some ENFJ or sfj you're really good at
working with people and caring about
what they like and making everybody get
on board and like what you're doing even
though it's weird random why are
you doing this think all because this is
my truth this is what I believe it and
I'll give out some logical reasons it's
very interesting so if you're playing
the myers-briggs game and you're
tracking the surface level you are
missing who you're really talking to
you're missing the core of real people"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference betwen Introverted Intuition (Ni) and Extroverted Intuition (Ne)", "completion": " all right getting towards the end of the
year we're gonna finish up the last of
2018 in the next few weeks with a hero's
journey series and then we're probably
gonna do something a little bit
different for 2019 I'll have more
details on that so how you can tell if
somebody or yourself has ni or any all
right so first thing to know everybody's
got intuition right you already know
this by now
so not the question is not does your mom
have intuition is she intuitive or
sensory that's not really the question
you want to be asking so everybody's
intuitive and everybody's sensory right
you want to be asking I know they have
intuition so where is it is it a savior
or a demon and is it introverted or
extroverted all right so it's kind of
ring that down we're first trying to
figure out if somebody or yourself has
ni or any you first got to figure out if
that's the Savior or a demon ideally
sometimes this works this way sometimes
it doesn't so you're looking at is the
person looking at the facts first and
then figuring out the concepts later or
are they looking at the concepts first
and then getting the facts later to
prove it right and it's not about do
they do either they're gonna do both
you're asking which one has the respect
around it and which one of the like it's
kind of assumed the intuitive Savior is
gonna give you the concept they're gonna
give you the guesses they're gonna give
you their assumptions and I'm gonna be
like yeah and then going to figure out
the facts to back that up that's on you
and then the sensory person is gonna be
other way around before they give you
their guesses and their intuition and
their assumptions they're gonna want you
to make sure that they have the facts
because they don't want to give you
guesses and assumptions and intuitions
out of nowhere they'll be ridiculous
they want to make sure that there's a
factual foundation first and sensory
first is usually a little bit nicer to
listen to because it makes a little bit
more sense don't give me your guesses
whether it's ni or any unless you have
first created some kind of a framework
of facts of which you're guessing from
otherwise you're just guessing and why
the hell should we believe you so that's
what you're really looking for and the
Savior or demon sense and then the next
thing is you're looking for okay is that
intuition gathering or is it organizing
is that intuition scattering or is it
bringing in so take a look at here at
this image this is something we've used
in our class Shanti's brought this up
it's worked really well
the intuition and I are any it's your
guesser you're looking beyond the facts
and you're trying to figure out what's
going on so the NE
has got a lot of different channels it's
on an extroverted spectrum so you may
have this guess or that guess or this
assumption or that assumption it's
playing the objective extroverted
spectrum where it's weighing out the
guesses you know using the groceries
that we talked about last
about as an example so you're looking at
like a grocery store and you're trying
to figure out how the the systems of the
grocery store work like oh I see that
they're stalking their shelves or
bringing it at night you so you're
trying to guess you try to look at the
sensory you're trying to figure out what
kind of systems they're using to stock
their shelves so remember their software
or whatever you're using your guesser
and so if you're sitting there guessing
with your friend and you're just
crapping out all of these great guesses
all these intuitions the any isn't like
ah that's a pretty good gasps sound
that's not such a good guess and it's
gonna look at the different little
channels these little little different
Delta rivers here and be able to look at
them on a spectrum of going that's a
good guess and that's not a good guess
and then the thing with the NE is it
doesn't like to then be narrowed in on
okay here's the one they'll want and
only good and best guess you can never
change and never update because remember
the extroverted functions te NE fe se
they're always looking for maybe there's
another way
maybe there's another little River that
popped up and that's a better one and we
should consider that right the ni is
more like this image where it's like hey
yeah yeah yeah you got a bunch of
different options a bunch of different
ways that's great and cute anyways man
I'm telling you this is the one not only
is this the one but I'm gonna work on
this one I'm gonna come back to this one
I think this is the concept I think this
is how the grocery store systems are
working I'm gonna put together my
guesses I'm gonna build my systems I
think it's consistent with the way
Walmart does it now if the ni is off off
from reality I mean they're wrong
they're in a lot of trouble cuz they're
going all-in on really carving out this
pattern in this world view in this
assumption their building is like a
Death Star and if they're wrong the
whole thing falls off the rails just
like ti-ti is gonna really think through
personal ideas and if it's off from
reality man they're in a lot of trouble
because they've invested a lot into this
idea or teehee is like I don't know that
looks like a good idea if a better one
comes along I'll drop this one and move
to the other I'm not married to the idea
I'm looking at the spectrum of ideas
pulling us all together you have ni or
any so is your mom you have it as a
savior or a demon doesn't really matter
and so what you're looking for is when
you go to start your guessing when you
start to make assumptions when you're
starting to try and figure out something
beyond the obvious do you like to dive
more deeply into the best guests that
you come up with and put more layers on
that one and I or is it more like yes I
have some good guesses but I'm always
hungry for another good guess because I
want to explore more
guesses and more options I don't ever
really want to be settled on any one
guess because there could be more so
always look for these things in a coin"}
