But first, let me tell you a bit about the show. Contrary to what you might’ve heard, we weren’t canceled by X. Yes, after months of begging me, wooing me to offer some exclusive content on his platform, Elon Musk decided to scrap the deal. But our plan is and always has been, to release this show everywhere, on YouTube, on Spotify, on iHeartRadio, just about any place you stream content.\n",

I don’t know. But my hope is that you learn something about both Elon and me, two people who come from completely different vantage points on almost every single issue. And I challenge you, Elon, to watch the whole interview and tell the world why this isn’t what you claim you want on X.\n",

    "Yeah. So the reason I’m saying that is because there are no conditions on this interview. You said that, “I’ll speak to you for an hour. I don’t like sound bites,” so I welcome that. So let’s get into it. So we are here in Austin, South by Southwest is going on. We’re at the Tesla headquarters. You are in the process of moving SpaceX here, I understand?\n",

So it is the number one way that people actually are informed about any kind of news, meaning real time events is on the X platform, formally Twitter, there’s nothing even close for real time news. So we also want to expand upon that and we have done so with the long form content. So instead of just doing what you used to call tweets, you can do long form posts. You can post an entire essay. In fact, you can now put an entire book, post an entire book to the platform. You can do long form video content, so you can do up to four hour video segments. We really want news in whatever form it is, or information I should say, in whatever form it is to be available on our platform, whether it’s short, long, text, pictures, video, whatever the case may be.\n",

It was the bestselling car despite being, I think around 50% more expensive than the next bestselling vehicle, of any kind, not just electric. So I think that’s a testament to the incredible work of the Tesla team. And we launched the Cybertruck. Obviously that’s being very well received. We have I think over a million orders for the Cybertruck. So it’s a really special product.

    "Don Lemon (23:18):\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah. Can we talk about the great replacement theory now? It’s one of the things that you post, a great replacement theory. You claim that Democrats, President Biden’s immigration plan to open up the border, you said that the President is getting, and Democrats are doing it, to get more votes, but undocumented immigrants cannot vote in federal elections, so how is that possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk (23:41):\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. You’re conflating two things. One is great replacement theory. The other is, which I don’t subscribe to that, I’m simply saying that there is an incentive here, if legal immigrants wish, I think have a very strong bias to, at least everything I’ve read, very strong bias to vote Democrat. The more that come into the country, the more they’re likely to vote in that direction. It is, in my view, a simple incentive to increase voters to Democrat voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "(24:14)\n",
    "Yeah. Your question is how. There’s a few ways that this works. One is that, when the census is done, the census is based on all people in an area, whether they are citizens or not. If there are a concentration of people who came here legally, in a particular state, that state will actually then get an increased number of House seats. The House seat apportionment is proportionate to number of people, not the number of citizens. The illegals overwhelmingly go to places like California and New York, and if you just look at the math, if you look at the apportionment with and without illegals, I believe California would lose… I believe there will be a net loss of blue states of approximately 20 seats in the House.\n",
    "\n",
    "(25:14)\n",
    "This also applies to the electoral college. You say this also applies to electing the president because the electoral votes are also done by apportionment the same way that House seats are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don Lemon (25:27):\n",
    "\n",
    "But the reason, Elon, the electoral college is in place is to balance that, so that doesn’t happen. What you’re saying about it is the exact opposite of the reason why the electoral college is there. The electoral college, at this point in our history, gives people who are in smaller states and red states much more of an influence over our elections than people who are in blue states and the majority of the people in this country. That’s what the electoral college does. It actually does the exact opposite of what you’re saying. It protects people who are in smaller states and protects people who are in red states. Red states because they tend to be smaller and less populous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk (26:04):\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that statement is… What you said is true, but what I said is also true, which is that, as is the case, a disproportionate number of illegal immigrants go to blue states, they amplify the effect of a blue state vote. And the math, as I understand it, you can research this obviously very easily on there, it’s pretty straightforward to research this, but my understanding is that the Democrats would lose approximately 20 seats in the House if illegals were not counted in census and that’s also 20 less electoral votes for President. Illegals absolutely do affect who controls the House and who controls the presidency does not affect the Senate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don Lemon (26:54):\n",
    "\n",
    "In blue states, you’re talking about. I don’t believe that your information on that is right. Listen, let’s talk more about the great replacement because the first time that you posted on X about this Jewish conspiracy, you ended up apologizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk (27:09):\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t call it a… I just said that there’s a simple matter of incentives. You don’t need a conspiracy when you have basic incentives. In my view, there’s a basic incentive. There’s fundamental… For the Democrat party to foster an usher in a large number of legals and you don’t need a conspiracy in that case because you have a very basic incentive. You could say I’m wrong about that incentive, but that’s my view. I’m not buying into some great replacement theory. I’m simply saying there appears to be a very clear incentive for Democrats to have to maximize the number of illegals because it helps them win elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don Lemon (27:46):\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m talking about the great replacement theory is also part of a Jewish conspiracy theory and when you did the tweet or you responded to the tweet about that, you ended up apologizing, which I think it is good that you ended up apologizing. You went to Auschwitz with Ben Shapiro.\n",

Flooding illegal-\n",

    "Elon Musk (28:59):\n",
